#  Connect ESP 32 to an Secure Wi-Fi network  
# Description
To connect the ESP32 to a specific Wi-Fi network, we should know its SSID and password. 
Additionally, that network must be within the ESP32 Wi-Fi range. After scanning the list of Wi-Fi networks we need to connect ESP 32 to one of the specific network. We have mainly two types of network connections are available these are open network and encrypted secure 
network. We can classify the type of network by using <b>WiFi.encryptionType 
(wifiAccesspoint)</b>.Where wifiAccesspoint is the name of the respective Wi-Fi network it will 
return the byte of data from that we can conclude which type of network.

   <i>step 1:</i> Connect ESP 32 board to the computer through USB cable  
   <i>step 2:</i> open the Arduino  
   <i>step 3:</i> 	Go to the file >  Preferences and then paste the below link at the Additional Boards Manager URL field
   https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json  
   <i>step 4:</i>	Go to the Tools  >  boards  >  Board manager and then install the ESP 32  



  
  


     


## Required Libraries
We need to include WiFi library to use WiFi funcationalities of ESP 32 WROVER -B Module

<b>#include <WiFi.h></b>

Once we install the ESP 32 boards to the IDE it can automatically adds the WiFi library
