# LED Blinking
# Description
The main aim of this experiment is getting some knowledge about how to handle ESP 32 and how to code it with arduino IDE.
Here we blink two LED's continuously with dealy between on & off of LED is 500 milliseconds.These LEDS are connected to the GPIO(General Purpose Input Output)pins 26 and 27. 


## Installation 
  <b>I.Arduino IDE</b>   
  <i>step 1:</i> Visit https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software  to download the latest Arduino IDE version for your computerâ€™s operating system. There are versions                      forWindows, Mac, and Linux systems.Download the suitable file for your system    
  
  <i>step 2:</i> Save the .exe file to your hard drive.  
  <i>step 3:</i> Open the .exe file & run the file and complete the Installation. 
  
  <b>II.Installing the ESP32 Board in Arduino IDE</b>  
  <i> step 1:</i> Connect ESP 32 board to the computer through USB cable  
   <i>step 2:</i> open the Arduino  
   <i>step 3:</i> Go to the file >  Preferences and then paste the below link at the Additional Boards Manager URL field
