# LED Blinking
# Description
The main aim of this experiment is getting some knowledge about how to handle ESP 32 and how to code it with arduino IDE.
Here we blink two LED's continuously with dealy between on & off of LED is 500 milliseconds.These LEDS are connected to the GPIO(General Purpose Input Output)pins 26 and 27. 


## Installation 
  1.Arduino IDE   
  step 1:
